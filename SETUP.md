# Application Setup Instructions

To setup the application ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed and follow the `Setup Steps` section below.

## Prerequisites

To build and run the solution in a development environment, you will need:

- [Microsoft 365 tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program/?WT.mc_id=m365-11189-cxa)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=m365-11189-cxa) subscription that is associated with the same Azure AD tenant as the M365 tenant (see section 1.2 below for details)
- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli/?WT.mc_id=m365-11189-cxa)
- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.1&WT.mc_id=m365-11189-cxa)
- [ngrok](https://www.ngrok.com) or equivalent tunneling solution for testing the Bot

## Setup Steps

The following instructions will help you get the project running locally on your computer. If you want to deploy it to Azure, you will need to adjust the URL of where the web app is hosted to match the URL of your web app in Azure.

### 1. Set up the web application

First, we'll set up the Customer Orders App, which is a single-page application and associated web service that provides the application's tabs.
#### 1.1 Set up SSL and a host name

Start by creating a self-signed SSL certificate and custom host name that will resolve to your computer. In these instructions, we use the host name _devappsforteams.local_; if you choose something different, please substitute your name for that one in the steps that follow. Note that your host name must be a valid DNS name (FQDN).

**NOTE:** Although ngrok provides a way to run a local server using SSL and access it externally, we won't be using it to serve the app since 2 tunnels would be needed (one for the app itself and one for the bot). As a result you would need a paid version of [ngrok](https://ngrok.com). While we won't be using ngrok here to run the app (due to the paid requirement), if you do have a paid version of ngrok you can skip this section and use the URL of your ngrok tunnel instead. You will use ngrok later in the setup process to get the bot up and running but the free version will work there.

##### 1.1.1 Create certificate authority and a certificate

1. Open terminal
1. Create a certificate authority by executing:

    ```sh
    npx mkcert create-ca --organization "MyOrg" --validity 825
    ```

1. Create a certificate by executing:

    ```sh
    npx mkcert create-cert --ca-key "ca.key" --ca-cert "ca.crt" --validity 825 --domains "devappsforteams.local"
    ```

    As the domain name, you can specify the DNS host name (FQDN) you chose to use throughout the project. In the next step, you will configure your computer to resolve this hostname to your local machine.

1. Follow the steps in [this article](https://bob1german.com/2020/10/17/setting-up-ssl-for-tabs-in-the-teams-toolkit-for-visual-studio-code/?WT.mc_id=m365-11189-cxa) to add the generated certificate authority to your cert store.

##### 1.1.2 Configure a host name for the tab and SSO web service

1. In a code editor (start as administrator), open your `hosts` file based on your target operating system:

    **Windows:** `c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`

    **Mac:** `/etc/hosts`
    
    Append your FQDN as shown next: `127.0.0.1    devappsforteams.local`
    
    **IMPORTANT:** Make sure that you replace `devappsforteams.local` with the FQDN you chose in the previous steps.

1. Save your changes

##### 1.1.3 Configure certificate and host name with the web app

1. In the `CustomerOrdersApp` folder, create a new folder named `.cert`
1. Copy the generated `cert.crt` and `cert.key` files to a new folder `CustomerOrdersApp/.cert`
1. In the code editor, open the `CustomerOrdersApp/server.js` file and update the value of the `domain` const (located toward the top of the file) to match your FQDN if you chose something different for your domain.

~~~javascript
domain = 'devappsforteams.local';
~~~

#### 1.2 Deploy Azure AD configuration

1. Obtain your Microsoft 365 tenant ID. This indicates the Azure AD instance that is used by your Microsoft 365 tenant. To obtain the Microsoft 365 tenant ID, browse to [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=m365-11189-cxa), log in with your development M365 account, and then browse to the Azure Active Directory option on the left. The Tenant ID on the overview page contains the tenant ID you need to use in your `az login` command.

![Tenant ID must match](./docs/images/TenantIDMatch.png)

> NOTE: If the Azure subscription you plan to use is associated with a different tenant ID, you will need to change it so both the Azure services and M365 are using the same Azure AD instance. Note that this change is likely to break other solutions already deployed in the Azure subscription, so if there are other solutions already in use, you'll want to obtain another Azure subscription and associate it with your M365 tenant. For detailed instructions, follow [this blog article](https://laurakokkarinen.com/how-to-use-the-complimentary-azure-credits-in-a-microsoft-365-developer-tenant-step-by-step) from MVP [Laura Kokkarinen](https://twitter.com/laurakokkarinen). 

1. In the code editor, open the `setup/setup.ps1` file
1. Change the value of the `$domain` variable to the FQDN you chose previously followed by `:8443`, eg. `devappsforteams.local:8443`
1. Start PowerShell
1. Change the working directory to `setup` (a folder located in this repository)
1. Login to Azure:

    ```powershell
    az login --tenant <REPLACE_WITH_TENANT_NAME_OR_ID> --allow-no-subscriptions
    ```

1. If this is the first time you've run a PowerShell script on this computer, run PowerShell as an administrator and enable script execution on your computer:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
    ```

1. Execute the setup script:

    ```powershell
    ./setup.ps1
    ```

    **Tip:**
    If the setup script fails with an `Request_ResourceNotFound` error, execute the script again. Sometimes creating the Azure AD app takes longer than expected and when the script continues, the app isn't fully provisioned yet. Running the script again will update the previously created app with the missing values.

1. Take note of the `AppId`, `AppPassword` and `AppUri` output by the setup script. Make sure that you save these values somewhere secure before continuing.

#### 1.3 Configure the web app

1. In the code editor open the `CustomerOrdersApp/.env sample` file
1. Change the value of the `AppId` and `AppPassword` properties to match the values returned by the setup script in the previous step
1. Save the file as `CustomerOrdersApp/.env`
1. Locate the `CustomerOrdersApp/src/environments/environment-sample.ts` file and perform the following tasks:

    - Make a copy of the file and add it in the same `environments` folder. 
    - Rename the newly copied file to `environment.ts`.

1. Open `environment.ts` and perform the following steps:

    - Change the `appId` property value to the `AppId` value that you saved in the previous section when setting up Azure Active Directory.
    - Later in the Bot steps you will also update the `botApiUrl` property value.

1. Add yourself as a sales person by modifying CustomerOrdersApp/data/sales-people.json. Change the name of one of the sales people to your name - specifically your name exactly as it appears when you're using Teams in your development tenant. This will ensure you have some customers to test with when using the Bot portion of the solution.

#### 1.4 Start the web app

1. Open terminal
1. Change the working directory to `CustomerOrdersApp`
1. Restore project dependencies by executing:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

1. Build the web app by executing:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

1. Start the web app by executing:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

1. Verify that you can open the web app, by navigating in the browser to `https://devappsforteams.local:8443`, where the domain name is the FQDN you chose previously

### 2. Set up the Bot

*Bots* allow users to interact with your application through conversational text, interactive cards, and task modules. *Messaging extensions* allow users to interact with your application service through buttons and forms in the Microsoft Teams client. They can search or initiate actions, and can interact with users when they compose a message, use the command box, or use the context menu directly from a chat message.

#### 2.1 Set up LUIS model (Language Understanding Intelligent Service)

Two Azure Cognitive Services, LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Services) and QnA Maker, are used to enable the bot to respond to natural language requests from users. In this section you'll set up the LUIS service which helps determine the user's intent and other details from the user's utterances.

1. Go to the [LUIS Portal](https://www.luis.ai/?WT.mc_id=m365-11189-cxa) and select `Login / Sign up`. Sign in with the same account used in Part 1 that has administrative rights to your Microsoft Azure subscription.

2. Select the arrow on the right side of the `New app` button and choose `Import as JSON`.

![Import the LUIS model](./docs/images/LUIS-1.png)

[Import](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-manage-versions?WT.mc_id=m365-11189-cxa#import-version) `'TailwindLuis.json'` file available under **Teams > services > CognitiveServices** folder. Give your model a name and click "Done" to import the model.

![Import the LUIS model](./docs/images/LUIS-2.png)

3. You will see a list of the _intents_ the Bot can respond to. Train your LUIS model by choosing `Train` on the top right.

    ```
    LuisAppId= <App-ID>
    LuisAPIKey= <Primary-Key>
    LuisAPIHostName=<Fully qualified domain name for hostname from Endpoint-URL>
    ```

#### 2.2 Set up QnA Maker


Two Azure Cognitive Services, LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Services) and QnA Maker, are used to enable the bot to respond to natural language requests from users. In this section you'll set up the QnA Maker service which uses search technology to find an response to the user's utterance.
##### 2.2.1 Create QnA Maker Knowledge Base

Go to [QnA Maker Portal](https://www.qnamaker.ai/?WT.mc_id=m365-11189-cxa) and select `Sign in` from top right. Sign in with your Azure admin account.

Leave te **Chit-chat** radio buttons set to `None` 5️⃣ (the chit-chat messages are already built into the knowledge base you imported).

![Create a Knowledge Base](./docs/images/QnA-2.png)

* **Step 5:** Select `Create your KB`.

Note: If you chose the free options when setting up QnA and get a message about the .tsv file being over 1 MB, you can select the **TailwindQnAMakerSmall.tsv** file. It's a smaller file with less questions in it.

##### 2.2.2 Train and publish your knowledge base

1. Select `Save and train` on the top right. 

![Create a Knowledge Base](./docs/images/QnA-3.png)

1. Click on `Test` in the top navigation bar and test your knowledge base by asking questions as the following examples: "How old are you?", "Do you breathe?", "Can you dream?".

5. Go to **PUBLISH** in the top navigation bar and select `Publish` to publish your knowledge base.
##### 2.2.3 Copy QnA Maker info to .env file

6. Under the **Postman** tab, copy your `KnowledgeBase-ID` from /knowledgebases/`xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx`/generateAnswer 1️⃣; also copy `Host` 2️⃣ and `Authorization: EndpointKey` 3️⃣. 

![Create a Knowledge Base](./docs/images/QnA-4.png)

Add the values to the `\teams\.env` file:

    ```
    QnAKnowledgebaseId= <KnowledgeBase-ID>
    QnAEndpointKey= <Authorization: EndpointKey>
    QnAEndpointUrl= <Endpoint URL>
    ```
 
#### 2.3 Configure Ngrok

Your app will run from a localhost server. You will need to setup Ngrok in order to tunnel from the Teams client to localhost. 

##### 2.3.1 Install Ngrok
Go to [Ngrok website](https://www.ngrok.com) and install ngrok.

##### 2.3.2 Run Ngrok

1. Unzip and open ngrok, then run the following script:

    `ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978`

2. Copy your ngrok URL `https://{subdomain}.ngrok.io`; you will need it in the next step. Make sure you copy the https and not the http URL.

3. The CustomerOrdersApp calls a web service in the bot to ask it to notify users of changes. To allow this to work, return to the `CustomerOrdersApp/src/environments/environment.ts` and change the `botApiUrl` property value to the ngrok URL of your bot (without a `/api/messages` or even a trailing `/`). 

4. Stop the Customer Orders web server you started earlier. Perform the following steps to rebuild and restart the server:

~~~bash
npm run build
npm run start
~~~

#### 2.4. Create Azure Bot Channels Registration

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=m365-11189-cxa) and select `+ Create a resource`. Search for `Bot Channels Registration` and choose `Create`. Fill the fields as follows and select `Create`:

    * **Bot handle:** Give a unique name to your bot (it must be unique across all of Microsoft Azure, so you may need to try a few options to find an available name)
    * **Subscription:** Choose your subscription
    * **Resource group:** Choose a resource group or create new
    * **Location:** Choose preferred location
    * **Pricing tier:** Choose preferred pricing tier; the free (F0) tier is fine for development
    * **Messaging endpoint:** For the Messaging endpoint URL, use the current `https` URL you were given by running ngrok and append it with the path `/api/messages`. It should like something work `https://{subdomain}.ngrok.io/api/messages`.
    * **Application Insights:** On
    * **Application Insights Location:** Choose preferred location
    * **Microsoft App ID and password:** Auto create App ID and password

Click Create to create the Bot channel registration.

![Register your bot](./docs/images/BotChannel-1.png)

2. Go to your **Bot Channels Registration** resource and select `Channels` from left-hand side menu 1️⃣. Choose `Microsoft Teams` icon to enable Teams as a channel 2️⃣. Agree to the terms of service and `Save`.

![Register your bot](./docs/images/BotChannel-2.png)

3. Go to **Settings** from left-hand side menu 1️⃣ and find `Microsoft App ID` and click on `Manage` link 2️⃣.

![Register your bot](./docs/images/BotChannel-3.png)

Clicking this link will bring you out of the Bot Channel Registration resource and into Azure AD, where you are now editing the Azure AD app registration that's used by the bot. The Azure Bot Channel you just created will use this application to authenticate itself to your bot. The App ID of this application is often referred to as the Bot ID; they are one and the same.

You will land in the **Certificates & secrets** section of this app registration.

4. In **Certificates & secrets**, select `+ New client secret` 1️⃣ and `Add`. Copy your new `Client Secret Value` 2️⃣.

> NOTE: You won't be able to copy or view the client secret once you leave this screen, but you can always creae a new one.

![Register your bot](./docs/images/BotChannel-4.png)

5. Go to **Overview** 1️⃣, and copy `Application (Client) ID` 2️⃣. 

![Register your bot](./docs/images/BotChannel-5.png)

6. Add the following fields in `.env` file:

    ```
    BotId= <Application-(Client)-ID>
    BotPassword= <Client-Secret-Value>
    ```

#### 2.5. Build and run your bot

Open your terminal in Visual Studio Code (`Ctrl+ Shift + '`) and type the following scripts in sequence:

1. Go to your Teams bot project folder:
    #### `cd Teams`

2. Install npm:
    #### `npm install`

3. Start your project:
    #### `npm start`

Now, your project is running on https://localhost:3978 which you've been tunneling with ngrok. To fully test the bot, ensure your Customer Orders App is still running as well (you'll need two terminal windows, plus one for ngrok).

### 2.6. Test your bot in Microsoft Teams

1. Go to [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) and login with your [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant/?WT.mc_id=m365-11189-cxa).

1. Within Teams, click "Chat" in the left sidebar 1️⃣, then click the New Message button 2️⃣. Paste the Bot ID (Bot's App ID obtained in section 2.3) into the To: box 3️⃣. Teams should find the bot name and show it in a pop-up 4️⃣; click the popup to begin conversing with the Bot. Type a test message into the compose area 5️⃣ and click Send.

![Test your bot](./docs/images/BotChannel-6.png)

1. Try saying some of these things to your new Bot:

      "Hello",

      "Get me my customer list",

      "Gimme customers",
      
      "Who is the latest customer",
      
      "Help",

      "How old are you",

      ...

### 3. Build and deploy the Teams app

> NOTE: The manifest.json file has a well documented schema! Check it out at [manifest schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema?WT.mc_id=m365-11189-cxa)

#### 3.1 Update Teams app manifest

1. In the Manifest folder, make a copy of the `manifest sample.json` file and name it `manifest.json`. Open `manifest.json` in a code editor.

2. Use the code editor's global replace feature to make the following substitutions:

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| <CRM_APP_ID> | The app ID you registered for the CustomerOrdersApp in section 1.2  |
| <CRM_HOST> | The hostname you selected for the CustomerOrdersApp such as devappsforteams.local |
| <CRM_PORT> | The port you are using for the CustomerOrdersApp, by default 8443 |
| <BOT_ID> | The Bot ID (the Bot's app ID) you created when you created the Azure Bot Channel registration in section 2.3 |

3. Review the manifest; you can change the descriptions and other details if you wish

#### 3.2 Create Teams app package

1. Open a terminal
1. Change the working directory to `Manifest`
1. Restore project dependencies by executing:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

1. Create Teams app package by executing:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

#### 3.3 Deploy app to Teams

1. In the web browser navigate to `https://teams.microsoft.com` and sign in with your dev account

2. From the left rail, select **Apps** 1️⃣. Open the **Upload a custom app** menu 2️⃣and in the submenu choose `Upload for <your-organization>` 3️⃣

![Install app](./docs/images/Package-1.png)

3. In the file dialog, select the generated `Manifest/CustomerOrders.zip` file

4. In the list of apps, select the newly added app 

![Install app](./docs/images/Package-2.png)

5. in the app's dialog, choose **Add** 1️⃣ to install the solution as a personal app (just for you). To install the solution in a Team or Group Conversation, click the arrow next to **Add** 2️⃣ and then select team or conversation 2️⃣.

![Install app](./docs/images/Package-3.png)

A dialog box will be displayed where you can select the channel or group conversation where you'd like to install the app.

1. After the app launched, from the tab-header bar choose **Customer App**. You should see the web app launched inside Teams

**NOTE:** The bot stores a list of people and Teams channels to notify when the app is installed. Because the bot's database is stored in memory, as soon as you restart the bot it will forget and those notifications won't be sent unless you remove and re-add the app.
